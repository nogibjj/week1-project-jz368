# Project 1: Cloud Continuous Delivery of Microservice

## Brief
In this project, we are supposed to build cloud continuous delivery of Microservice in FlaskAPI. In paritcular, I build a simple Checkweekday FlaskAPI using Python, which checks the exact weekday (e.g., Friday) of an input date (e.g., 2027-10-1) either in the past or in the future. Through this project, I obtain a better understanding of how to deploy a useful Microservice API in the server.

### Key Result: 
* 1) Test the codebase locally.
* Usage of examples: anca32dvu7.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/change/1/38
